# Focus timer
This little script helps one to do breaks during work and reflect on it by asking you questions. It simply sets a timer and gives a notification (via notify-send) if the work time is up and asks the user a question after each break.

## Usage

### There are two modes you can choose:

- *Planning mode*: This mode is useful if you want to __make a plan__ about how you handle a problem. It sets a hard timer and after the timer is up you can not extend it.
This mode wants to force you to keep your creativity alive and you thinking clear with regular breaks.
After the break, a question is shown which will (hopefully) let you reflect and rethink on the work you have done yet.

- *Flow mode*: This mode is useful when you execute your plan to create the solution. There shouldn't be critical thinking or architectural element to those tasks. It is the "get it done" mode.
After the timer is up you can reset it to the overtime (option -o) or make a break.
After the break it will ask you a question to rethink what you have done.

Feel free to open a pull request. Especially new questions would be great!
New questions should be general and must not be a yes or no question (because this blocks the creative thinking process).
